# landing-page
Site is live here thanks to Github pages, frontend engineering is much more tacklable than I first thought.
I'mma master HTML, CSS, HTMX and JS, and basically make those my bread and butter.
I might learn React at this point, but as a technology I feel like I would be learning it for job opportunities.
Not a terrible idea, but also... idk. Future me can figure that out.
